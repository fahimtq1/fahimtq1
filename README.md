# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fahim, a former Physics student with experience in Python, machine learning, and devops. My long-term goal is to become a solutions architect, and I'm working towards this by expanding my knowledge in the areas of cloud engineering, machine learning, and devops.

## About Me

During my Physics degree, I gained experience using Python for data visualisation and transformation with libraries such as `numpy` and `matplotlib`. I completed a machine learning module covering topics such as `scikit-learn`, `conformal prediction`, `linear regression`, `data pre-processing`, `parameter selection`, `kernel methods`, `neural networks`, `pipelines`, and `cross-conformal prediction`.

In addition to my academic experience, I have hands-on experience in devops. I've worked with `terraform` and `ansible` for infrastructure as code, `AWS` for cloud engineering (including CCP exams), `Kubernetes` and `Docker` for containerisation, `Jenkins` for CI/CD, and `Vagrant` and `Virtual Box` for virtualisation. I also conduct personal projects to learn more and expand my skills in areas such as machine learning, cloud engineering, and devops.

## Current Job

In my current role, I analyze the maturity of various services and ensure they meet certain standards across multiple disciplines, such as `finops`, `chaos engineering`, `FT`, `NFT`, `cloud engineering`, and `resiliency`. I work with stakeholders to identify areas of improvement and develop plans to address them.
